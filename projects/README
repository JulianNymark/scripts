This is a directory for scripts of various sorts.
Feel free to use and modify!! (as if I could stop you when posting them on github :P)

I try to use as many common commands as possible so that
the scripts can/should work everywhere!!

Also, if there is something horribly wrong or has great potential for improvement
(more readability in many of my cases), don't hesitate to point it out!
