USAGE:
    sudo backup <drive LABEL Name> [other dir in home]

Notes:
* if [other dir in home] is not specified, a dir named /home/$USER/important is
    attempted to be backed-up.
* make sure you don't have multiple disks with the same name! and renaming disks to 
    short nice names will help as well.
* you might have to replace $USER with your actual username unless you are copying a
    file from root's home or can mount disks without sudo. :)
    in that case you can call the command without sudo entirely
* the disk is referenced by label, so use "blkid" or browse /dev/disk/by-label/ to get
    familiar with disk name
* the backup system is semi-friendly by using "cp's" -b [OPTION], this keeps a 2 file
    history of multiple backups of the same file name
    (so if you get an 'Oh sh**' moment, you MIGHT not have to worry :P)
* it also uses the -u option, that only cp's if source file is newer than destination,
    (or if no destination file is available)
